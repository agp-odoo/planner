<h1>Custom Planning Module</h1>
<div>
    The idea of this module is to have a board where users can share ideas for projects, sourcing, or other company related topics.
    <br>This is great for new businesses that want to grow and take on other profitable opportunities. 

    <h2>Example:</h2>
    <p>
        If a user thinks the company should open up an office in a new location, they can submit a new stage on the board
        <br>with resources that help the company make the idea become reality. The user could post possible office spaces under the stage, or
        <br>resources that help the company understand the local law system (licenses, fees, taxes, etc.).
